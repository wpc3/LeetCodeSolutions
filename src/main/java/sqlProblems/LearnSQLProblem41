Question: Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance.

          Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group.

select
case when patient_id % 2 == 0 then 'Yes'
else 'No'
end as has_insurance,
case when patient_id % 2 == 0 then count(patient_id) * 10
else count(patient_id) * 50
end as cost_after_insurance
